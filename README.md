### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science major (BSCS) from Western Governors University. Have some information about me;

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different projects, but mainly doing research into more C++ application design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI\UX design.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on collective designs for open source applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always down for a good, civilized, conversation.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him - you're welcome to refer to me as they/them, I'm not offended :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: If potatoes can power clocks, they could power other things. How many potatoes does it take to power a PC? I heard nuclear power being called "lazy", and lazy people in America are called "couch potatoes", that means that nuclear power is one powerful potato!
