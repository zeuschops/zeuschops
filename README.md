### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zeuschops/zeuschops** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different projects, but mainly doing research into more C++ application design.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI\UX design.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on collective designs for open source applications.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always down for a good, civilized, conversation.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him - you're welcome to refer to me as they/them, I'm not offended :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: If potatoes can power clocks, they could power other things. How many potatoes does it take to power a PC? I heard nuclear/renewable power being called "lazy" and "lazy" people in America are called couch potatoes, thus nuclear power is a very powerful potato. ğŸ˜„
