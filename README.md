### Hi there 👋

I am a fourth-year University student with 2 courses left before I graduate. Have some information about me;

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few different projects, but mainly doing research into more C++ application design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UI\UX design.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on collective designs for open source applications.
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I'm always down for a good, civilized, conversation.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him - you're welcome to refer to me as they/them, I'm not offended :)
- ⚡ Fun fact: If potatoes can power clocks, they could power other things. How many potatoes does it take to power a PC? I heard nuclear/renewable power being called "lazy" and "lazy" people in America are called couch potatoes, thus nuclear power is a very powerful potato. 😄
