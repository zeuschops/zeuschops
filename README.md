### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science major (BSCS) from Western Governors University. Have some information about me;

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [advent of code](https://github.com/zeuschops/advent-of-code-2020).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Swift and C++!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on iOS, MacOS, or IoT-powered libraries or general development of said devices.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything! I'm always down for a good conversation!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: If potatoes can power clocks, they could power other things. I also heard nuclear power being called "lazy", and lazy people in America are called "couch potatoes", does that mean that nuclear power is one powerful potato?
